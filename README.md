## Installation
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.8+

- pip (Python package manager)

- Django 3.2+

- SQLite (default)

- A working email service (e.g., Gmail) for sending email notifications.

## Steps to Run the Project Locally
Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IVON1010/BibliothekHub.git
cd BibliothekHub
```
## Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
## Activate the Virtual Environment

On Windows:

## Set Up Email Backend

### For email notifications to work, you'll need to configure your email settings in the settings.py file. Example (for Gmail):

- python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-email-password'
Note: Replace the EMAIL_HOST_USER and EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD with your actual email credentials. If you're using Gmail, consider creating an App Password for added security.
